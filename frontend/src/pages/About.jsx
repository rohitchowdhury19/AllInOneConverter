    <Section title="Our mission">
      <p>
        We believe everyday file conversions shouldn't require an account, a
        subscription, or handing your documents to a third party. AllInOneConverter
        brings a growing collection of PDF and image utilities together in one
        place — fast, free, and built to respect your privacy.

    <Section title="What we offer">
      <p>
        From converting PDF pages to PNG images, merging and splitting
        documents, signing and watermarking files, to compressing, resizing,
        and converting images between formats — our tools cover the most common
        document and image tasks without ever leaving your browser.
