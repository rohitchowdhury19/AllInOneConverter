    <Section title="Our commitment">
      <p>
        AllInOneConverter is designed around data minimization, a core principle of the
        EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). We aim to collect as little
        data as possible and to process your files without retaining them.
      </p>
    </Section>

    <Section title="Data we process">
      <p>
        Files you convert are processed in your browser where possible, or
        transiently on the server when required, and are not stored afterward.
        We do not require accounts and do not collect personal information to
        operate the tools. Limited anonymous diagnostics may be used to keep the
        service reliable.
      </p>
    </Section>

    <Section title="Legal basis for processing">
      <p>
        Where we process any limited data, we rely on legitimate interests —
        specifically, delivering and maintaining a secure, functional service —
        and on your consent where required.
      </p>
    </Section>

    <Section title="Your rights under GDPR">
      <p>If you are in the EU/EEA, you have the right to:</p>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
        <li>Access the personal data we hold about you.</li>
        <li>Request correction or erasure of your data.</li>
        <li>Object to or restrict certain processing.</li>
        <li>Data portability, where applicable.</li>
        <li>Lodge a complaint with your local supervisory authority.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Because we generally don't store your files or maintain user accounts,
        there is usually little or no personal data for us to act on — but you
        may contact us to exercise any of these rights.
      </p>
    </Section>

    <Section title="International data transfers">
      <p>
        Any transient processing is carried out using infrastructure with
        appropriate safeguards in place. We do not retain your files in any
        region after your request is complete.
      </p>
    </Section>

    <Section title="Contact">
      <p>
        For any GDPR-related request or question, reach us through the links in
        the site footer.
